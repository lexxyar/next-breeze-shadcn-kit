# Laravel Breeze - Next.js Edition with TypeScript and ShadCn
(TailwindCSS inside)

---
**This repository created from scratch using some features of [breeze-next](https://github.com/laravel/breeze-next). [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programming language used as default. [ShadCn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) used as UI library. And of course [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) inside 😎**

### Little extras
* Dark mode support
* Profile modification support - [Laravel Breeze modifications for profile editing](BREEZE_MODIFICATIONS.md)
---

### Installation

First, create a Next.js compatible Laravel backend by installing Laravel Breeze into a [fresh Laravel application](https://laravel.com/docs/installation) and installing Breeze's API scaffolding:

```bash
# Create the Laravel application...
laravel new next-backend

cd next-backend

# Install Breeze and dependencies...
composer require laravel/breeze --dev

php artisan breeze:install api
```

Next, ensure that your application's `APP_URL` and `FRONTEND_URL` environment variables are set to `http://localhost:8000` and `http://localhost:3000`, respectively.

After defining the appropriate environment variables, you may serve the Laravel application using the `serve` Artisan command:

```bash
# Serve the application...
php artisan serve
```

Next, clone this repository and install its dependencies with `yarn install` or `npm install`. Then, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env.local` and supply the URL of your backend:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Finally, run the application via `npm run dev`. The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`:

```
npm run dev
```

> Note: Currently, we recommend using `localhost` during local development of your backend and frontend to avoid CORS "Same-Origin" issues.

### Authentication API

This Next.js application contains a custom `useAuth` API functions set, designed to abstract all authentication logic away from your pages. In addition, the functions set can be used to access the currently authenticated user:

```js
const ExamplePage = () => {
    const { logout, user } = useAuth({ middleware: 'auth' })

    return (
        <>
            <p>{user?.name}</p>

            <button onClick={logout}>Sign out</button>
        </>
    )
}

export default ExamplePage
```

> Note: You will need to use [optional chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining) (`user?.name` instead of `user.name`) when accessing properties on the user object to account for Next.js's initial server-side render.

### Profile API

This Next.js application contains a custom `useProfile` API functions set, designed to modify user profile information, change password and delete account.

### Named Routes

For convenience, [Ziggy](https://github.com/tighten/ziggy#spas-or-separate-repos) may be used to reference your Laravel application's named route URLs from your React application.
